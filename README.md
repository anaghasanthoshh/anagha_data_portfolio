## About Me

I am a **Data Quality & Governance Analyst** with hands-on experience supporting enterprise data migration and supply chain transformation initiatives. I specialize in ensuring **data accuracy, completeness, and consistency** across systems through data validation, reconciliation, lineage documentation, and KPI reporting.

I bring a strong balance of **business and technical expertise**, enabling me to translate business requirements into data quality rules, perform root-cause analysis of data issues, and support governance frameworks that enable trusted, data-driven decision-making.

I have recently completed an **MSc in Data Science & Analytics** and am actively seeking opportunities in **Data Quality, Data Governance, or Data Analytics** roles.
